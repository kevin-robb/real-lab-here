The Data_Generator directory contains the source and example config file for the application which simulates the environment and prints the results of the simulation to a file called "outputyyyy-MM-dd_HHmmssSSS.txt" each time the application is run. Edit and build the source using your favorite text editor and Java compiler.

The main file for this application contains extra (currently dead) code which was used throughout the development process to verify the soundness of the algorithms used. These are called "loudRun", "loudResourceRun", and "fancyRun". These can be ignored/deleted without compromising the application or turned on via a command line argument to provide a more detailed or simply different look at the status of the simulation at each point in time.

For more information on how to read/write the config file, see "Understanding config.txt.txt".

The Analyze_Data_100_120 directory contains both a lot of in-between files used to store data prior to analysis and the files showing the results of the analysis. It also contains the Mathematica notebooks which do the bulk of the work and other notebooks which can be used to obtain various statistics and plots of the in-between information. This folder is called "...100_120" because there are two actions available in this state-action space with expected returns of 100 and 120 units of resource. There is also one called "...100_100", which functions primarily the same with a different simulation environment.

Inside the Analyze_Data_100_120 directory, there are four more directories named after the presence of knowledge sharing and resource sharing in the simulations they contain. For example, "K0R1" contains the files for simulations with no knowledge sharing (K=0) and with resource sharing (R=1). Initially, these four directories only contain the "Capstone.jar" (same in all four directories) and "config.txt" files (different depending on the desired simulation environment). During my work, I used samples of 50 simulations for each scenario, so there are now also 50 output*.txt files in each directory. Make sure to move or delete these before running your own simulations.

Also located in the Analyze_Data_100_120 directory are three cmd scripts. These run the "Evaluate" and/or "Analyze" steps of the entire process depending on the script run. In order for the "Analyze" process to run using these scripts, the Mathematica folder containing "math.exe" must be included in your system PATH variable. Alternatively, the notebooks run by the script can be opened in Mathematica and evaluated from there.

EvaluateNotebooks.nb.evaluator is a helper Mathematica notebook that is used by the aforementioned cmd scripts. There should be no need to modify this for any reason.

Plots.nb uses the output*.txt files to plot the values of the measured variables over time.

Plots_overlap.nb does the same, but overlays all of the samples instead of averaging the data.

RANOVA.nb is the big data-cruncher based on the included paper "A Randomized ANOVA Procedure for Comparing Performance Curves".

The "*_gimmedemstats.nb" and "*.showall.nb" files are just for extra stats and plots that you might find useful.

"Find p-values.nb" calculates p-values for two-way RANOVA using the *.wdx files generated by RANOVA.nb or generating them itself.

All of the *.wdx files in the Analyze_Data_100_120 directory are generated during the execution of "RANOVA.nb" or "Find p-values.nb". They contain the results of each completed RANOVA. This is useful if you need to interrupt the execution of that notebook for any reason, as the results for any fully completed analysis will be imported and not re-run when execution starts over (trust me, this can save you days of computer time). Make sure to move/delete these files whenever either 1. you redo the "Evaluate" process, or 2. you modify the processing done in RANOVA.nb.
